# README

This is a tokenUpdater app, that tops off a users tokens if they meet specific criteria.

## Dependencies

run `bundle install`

## Quick Setup

Place the code block below in challenge.rb.

```data_loader = DataImporter.new('./fixtures/users.json')
user_data = data_loader.company_data

data_loader = DataImporter.new('./fixtures/companies.json')
company_data = data_loader.company_data

company_data_manager = CompanyDataManager.new(user_data, company_data)
report_data = company_data_manager.report_data

report_generator = CompanyReportGenerator.new(report_data)
report_generator.generate_output_file

```

cd `lib` and run `ruby challenge.rb`

The output file will be created in _/lib/fixtures_

## Tests

run `rspec spec` in the root folder
